# Minecraft Coordinate Book

This is a small, vanilla styled mod that lets you write notes, or coordinates. This mod is made for quilt originally, but should work on fabric as well. (The mod is now developed on fabric to keep compat)

It uses the same GUI as a traditional book, but it's completely client-side, for each coordinate you can keep notes, to keep track of why you were there.

If you die, you keep it in your menu, and it's not individual per each world; you can still access it if you aren't in the same world. 

While this is supposed to be used for coordinates, you can write whatever you want in this.

**Warning**: Some servers may count this as cheating, while I don't see this as being any different to writing them down or putting them on a document, some server owners may disagree

## FAQ

> What versions?

Whichever stay relevant, I'm hoping to keep it up to date on the latest version, but I most likely won't update to 1.17 or earlier.

Currently, it's on 1.18.x and 1.19.x

> Forge/Fabric?

The mod should work on fabric and quilt already. However forge is probably not going to get an official port.

If you want to port it to forge yourself, you're more than welcome to.

> Can I use this in my modpack?

Yes, you can use it in your modpack. Preferably, with credit (Of course, if you can, please do) but you cannot claim it's your own mod.

> Where do I download it?

It's downloadable here, modrinth and ~~curseforge~~ (As of v1.3.0, curse is no longer supported).

Go to the releases tab on the right to see it here, or go to a different site;
