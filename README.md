# Minecraft Vanilla Notebook

This is a small, vanilla-styled mod that lets you write notes in-game.

It uses a similar GUI as a traditional book, but it's completely client-side and global - It will persist across worlds and servers.
## FAQ

> What versions?

I try and keep it on the latest version, but if people stick to specific versions I will support those for longer, until something else becomes more relevant. Versions older than 1.20.5 may not be supported, as some changes in java 21 are very useful.

> Forge/Fabric?

The mod should work on fabric and quilt already. However forge is probably not going to get an official port.

If you want to port it to forge yourself, you're more than welcome to - I will accept PRs and add branches to support forge if someone wants to maintain them.

> Can I use this in my modpack?

Yes, you can use it in your modpack. Preferably, with credit.

> Where do I download it?

It's downloadable on GitHub, my Forgejo instance Modrinth and Curseforge. 

Curseforge is the least priority, so I would recommend checking here or Modrinth first.

Go to the releases tab to see it here, or go to a different site;

- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/notebook
- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notebook
- Forgejo: https://git.sillyjune.xyz/juniper/Minecraft-Vanilla-Notebook
- Github: https://github.com/JunePrimavera/Minecraft-Vanilla-Notebook
