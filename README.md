# Minecraft Coordinate Book

This is a small, vanilla styled mod that lets you write notes, or coordinates. This mod is made for quilt, but should work on fabric as well (UNTESTED!)

It uses the same GUI as a traditional book, but it's completely client-side, for each coordinate you can keep notes, to keep track of why you were there.

If you die, you keep it in your menu, and it's individual per each world; however you can still access it if you aren't in the same world. 

**WARNING:** Some servers may count this as cheating, while I don't see this as being any different to writing them down or putting them on a document, some server owners may disagree

**WARNING:** This mod, and the Quilt modloader, are WIP, please make any bug reports, but there is currently **no jar file** and there won't be until it's ready.

## FAQ

> When will it be released?

I don't know, hopefully by the end of next month (August 2022)

> What versions?

Whichever stay relevant, I'm hoping to keep it up to date on the latest version, but I probably won't update to 1.17 or earlier.

> Forge/Fabric?

The mod _should_ work on fabric already. However forge is likely not going to get an official port.

If you want to port it to forge yourself, you're more than welcome to.

> Can I use this in my modpack?

Yes, you can use it in your modpack. You don't need to credit me (Of course, if you can, please do) but you cannot claim it's your own mod.

> Where do I download it?

Currently (As of July 2022) there is no download.

When it's done, it'll be downloadable on Curseforge, Modrinth and here on GitHub.
